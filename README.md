📊 **IPL Analyzer Dashboard
🔎 Project Overview**
This project analyzes Indian Premier League (IPL) matches using Power BI. It highlights team performance, player statistics, toss impact, and season-wise trends. The dashboard helps cricket fans, analysts, and franchises explore IPL data interactively and make data-driven insights.

❓ **Problem Statement**
The IPL produces massive amounts of data each season. While detailed statistics exist, they are often presented in raw tables, making it hard for fans and analysts to draw meaningful conclusions. An interactive dashboard is needed to simplify analysis and provide actionable insights.

🎯 **Goal of the Project**
Deliver an interactive Power BI dashboard for IPL data.
Enable quick answers to questions like:
Who are the top run-scorers and wicket-takers?
How does toss decision affect match outcomes?
Which teams perform better when batting first vs chasing?
Provide insights to support fan engagement, team strategies, and sports analysis.
